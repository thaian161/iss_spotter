# The Approach

We'll be making API requests to three different services to solve this problem.

1. Fetch our IP Address
2. Fetch the geo coordinates (Latitude & Longitude) for our IP
3. Fetch the next ISS flyovers for our geo coordinates

Each later step is dependent on data from the previous one.

We will eventually be able to use our app in the following way:

```
> node index.js
Next pass at Fri Jun 01 2021 13:01:35 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) for 465 seconds!
Next pass at Fri Jun 01 2021 14:36:08 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) for 632 seconds!
Next pass at Fri Jun 01 2021 16:12:35 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) for 648 seconds!
Next pass at Fri Jun 01 2021 17:49:29 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) for 648 seconds!
Next pass at Fri Jun 01 2021 19:26:12 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) for 643 seconds!
```

The dates and durations above will, of course, be different based on when the program is run.
